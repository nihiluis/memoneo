# Memoneo CLI
Command line interface for syncing your markdown notes to the Memoneo server, built with oclif.

## Getting started
To use the CLI, you currently need to build it from source with your own configuration params.

```bash
pnpm run build
```

### Build options
Building the CLI requires a `config.json` file in your working directory with default settings if one doesn't exist. The default configuration looks like:

```json
{
  "baseDirectory": "_testdata",
  "defaultDirectory": "_unassigned",
  "basePath": {
    "dev": "/",
    "prod": "/web"
  },
  "productName": "Memoneo",
  "authApiUrl": {
    "dev": "http://localhost:8089",
    "prod": "https://your.prod.instance.com"
  },
  "masterApiUrl": {
    "dev": "http://localhost:8094",
    "prod": "https://your.prod.instance.com"
  }
}
```

## Commands
Note: if you build the CLI from source, you will have to set up the executable (provided by Oclif in ./bin/run.js).

Alternatively, you can run ./bin/dev.js <command> to test the commands without building.

### Init
Initialize Memoneo in the current directory and connect to the Memoneo server.

```bash
memoneo init [--mail=<email>] [--password=<password>]
```

Options:
- `-m, --mail` - Your email address
- `-p, --password` - Your password

### Download
Download notes from remote.

```bash
memoneo download
```

### Upload

```bash
memoneo upload [--dir=<directory>]
```

Options:
- `--dir` - The target directory that is recursively searched for md files (optional)

### Sync

```bash
memoneo sync [--dir=<directory>]
```
