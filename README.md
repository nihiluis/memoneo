The motivation of the to 

- show me tasks that I have to do

- take notes in a diary format
    - date must be trackable
- allow me to fill simple surveys about how I feel etc.
- show me weekly/monthly/yearly reports
- make notes pinnable and searchable so I can find them if I want to
- enable me to add voice messages and images to a note
